## Object-Oriented Javascript and Prototypal Inheritance

### Classical vs Prototypal Inheritance
  > Inheritance: one obj gets access to the properties and methods of another object
  > Classical Inheritance: is about most known and popular, such as in C#, Java...has been done for a long time -> build a large, huge collections, objects...it would be so hard to firgure out how it's going
  > Prototypal: Inheritance is much simpler, it's flexible, extensible, easy to understand

### Understanding the Prototype
  > All objects (incl function) have a prototype property: obj.prototype. the prototype is simply a reference to another object, call it as "proto"
